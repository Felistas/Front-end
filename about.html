<h3>ABOUT FELISTAS NGUMI:</h3>
 <p> Felistas Ngumi grew up in the North East but spent twenty years living and working in England.  She trained as a theatre designer and worked in this field for several years whilst developing her own style and methods as a self taught glass artist. She derives her own special artistic brand, unusual medium techniques with trademark metallic grout through both inspiration and experience.  In London, Felistas became one of the leading glass artists before returning to the North East in 2001 to launch her business ‘Unique In Glass’.  Her studio is based at a Northumbrian farmhouse near the Roman Wall, where the magnificent countryside and historic interest supplies a constant inspiration.</p>
